Three serial ports:
1) rfmon - reads rf input upon carriage return.
    Possible cases of input:
       * Round start
       * Round end
       * Robots states, including which robot the info is about, this
robot's id, x and y coordinates, angle, score
       * Territory states, including which territory this info is about,
the territory's owner, balls remaining, rate limit
2) ledCtrl - writes output - the RGB values for the six LED's.
3) drainCounter - idle (declared in the code, but never used again)

Besides having these two functional serial ports that read/write
information, the code also updates the states of robots and the territories
based on the input information, and computes the LED RGB values based on
the states of information. It also draws robots, the field, LED boxes,
balls, etc. for visualization purposes.
