Instructions to run the vision system in the mock competition.
Detects fiducial patterns (available in /vision/resources).Requires OpenCV to be installed.  See http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/InstallGuide%20%3A%20Debian for details on building OpenCV for Ubuntu/Debian.  Those instructions are slightly out of date, so you'll have to change some of the package names to get them to install correctly.  After running "make install" I also had to run "export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH" to get it to work, your mileage may vary.

1) plug in transmitter happy board
2) turn on happyboard and hit go after the comm light blinks (it should turn on steady after)
3) open terminal. Type "cd 6.270/vision_p" and hit tab, then enter 
4) type "./run_vision 0 /dev/ttyUSB0 A   //runs a script to run the Makefile and set camera to proper light/color levels. run_vision takes three arguments: camera number, serial port, and table letter
 
 
Keyboard shortcuts once vision is runnning:
r – starts a round, and can be hit mid-round to reset timer to 1 minute
! – ends a round and shuts down the competing robot (useful for runaways)
R – ends a  round without shutting down the robot
p – switches between camera view and playing field view, make sure there aren’t stray fiducials in the camera view as they will be recognized
i – in camera view, this allows selecting the playing field corners to recalibrate.  Hit i, then, starting with the upper left corner, click each corner going clockwise
i: Map projection Corners
r: Start/Restart a Round
!: End Match
s: pick sample corners???
+: Zoom In
-: Zoom Out
E: Exclude Corners
f: Show fps
z: Pause / photo finish
spacebar: filter squares
