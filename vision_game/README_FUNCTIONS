                resets sightings[], teams[], then copies teams.tsv 
                to teams[].  Then it hits the main loop.  Grabs a camera frame,
                processes it, some warping, some loading of images.  then converts 
                camera image to grayscale, and runs findCandidateSquares() 
                to find things like fiducial squares, then processSquares() 
                to detect and interpret the fiducials.  At 1420, 
                I think it sets a sync byte in robots[0].id as 0xAA
                then processes each robots sightings[i] count to figure 
                out the top two "most seen" robots and assume that both 
                are on the field  (unless sightings[] is 0 for all or
                all but one of the robots, then it only does the appropriate
                match or nothing).  It stores the (one indexed since robot[0]
                is the sync bit) robot[id] into gameData.coords[0] and [1]
                It updateHUD(), handleKeypresses(), updateGame()
